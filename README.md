# Dotfiles

My dotfiles, managed with [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/)

## Install

Before installing, see [DEPENDENCIES.md](./DEPENDENCIES.md) for details about requirements.

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `./install` (can be safely executed again later).

### Additional steps

* `tmux` plugins need to be installed separately with https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm
* Gnome terminal config needs to be restored, see [gnome-terminal](./gnome-terminal)

## Configuration

See [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/) docs for more info
and [install.conf.yaml](./install.conf.yaml) for examples.
